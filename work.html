		<h1>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1>
		<p>Beginning in October 2020, I have been involved in the workforce. When I was 15, I began working my first part-time job as a crew member at McDonaldâ€™s where I became comfortable with functioning in fast-paced environments, improved my customer service abilities, and team communication, all of which are invaluable skills that I use at my current job as a medical office assistant.</p>

		<h1>CAREER PREP</h1>
		<p>To explore my interest in tech, I enroll in computer science and robotics courses at school and at home, I self-study various coding and scripting languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL through online platforms such as Coursera. To date, I have completed a professional certificate in UX Design from Google and two specializations, one in web development and the other in Python, from the University of Michigan.</p>
